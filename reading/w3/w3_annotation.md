1. I believe that the obligations of children to their parents are mainly
    legal and moral.

    Legal obligations are specific and are strong.
    Depending on the local laws, adopted children may or may not have
    obligations to their adopted parents.
    If children are considered to fail legal obligations,
    it will probably be practical to force them to carry out such obligations,
    or make up for them, or even punish them under the law.

    On the contrary, moral obligations are general.
    No matter whether the child is adopted,
    they have moral obligations to their parents.
    So, adopted children should still be condemned if they fail these
    obligations, but I see no ground to force them to carry out the obligations
    or the punish them.

1. The professors' discussion on the relationship between love and marriage is
    very interesting.

    The relationship between love and marriage has been shaped differently by
    different influences.
    On the one hand, society and government push the individuals to get married
    mainly for practical purposes such as the economy.
    On the other hand, the literature such as fictions often focus on promoting
    "romantic love," where getting married based on the feeling of love is a
    common happy theme.

    Personally, I think love and marriage are not inherently related.
    Marriages are usually practical and often calculated,
    the implications of getting married are well beyond being together.
1. It is funny to see the professors argue that they are probably not qualified
    to comment about polyamory because they have not been polyamorous.

    I think a major problem of polyamory is simply its unpopularity.
    Most people today still believe that monogamy is the norm.
    People would try to pretend that they are not attracted to someone else when
    they are in a relationship to keep their current relationship going.
    Or, they might pursue their feelings to someone else in a sneaky way,
    which is cheating.
