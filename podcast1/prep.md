## Wen

> This cultivation of rituals also prevents us from focusing too narrowly on our goals, such as completing homework, but rather on developing virtues (Cline, 2015).

Cultivation of rituals let us focus on developing virtues.
This is saying nothing, so something is not expressed well.

> However, why do I need to cultivate so many virtues?

This is a deep question.

> If this is still true that the filial pattern could teach us to care for others outside the family, why would there be someone behaving bad to their parents but good to others, feeling reckless in the intimate relationship?

Yes, indeed the logic does not follow here.
Good critique to Confucianism.

> Considering the smaller family size, looser family connection, and the enhancing individualism in modern China, extensive family as a community is having less participation in the formation of expectation on an individual while parents are participating more.

How is individualism enhancing?

> I would expect my own children to practice filial piety because I grew up with parents’ selfless cultivation and would do the same for my children.

How does that carry through?
