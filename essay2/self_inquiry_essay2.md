"Work" as an English word has various meanings [@cholbi2023philosophical].

The meaning of work is, first and foremost, activities that generate value,
especially financial value.

While many have mentioned in class that most people work to earn a living
[@pouille2023ethics], sometimes people work for free.

Volunteering is more and more frequently used to dress up free labor harvests
[@kelemen2017more].

Machines can generate value and replace some of the human labor.

In class, Professor Pouille argues that we should not *rely* on technologies,
and I argue that relying on a technology is convenient but only acceptable if
it has been thoroughly tested and we trust it to work consistently
[@pouille2023ethics].

However, if we change our angle and look at why some people cannot work,
we see a different meaning in work itself.

Some believe that the advance of technology will render a class of people
unemployable because all their skills will be replaced by machines
[@harari2017meaning].
I, however, believe that what makes people unemployable is much more likely
their social status than their capabilities.

On the flip side, people who do get to work seem to benefit from socially.

People are attached to their work by getting attached to the community
[@cholbi2023philosophical].

During forced "voluntolding," many people come to accept what they are told to
do and start to enjoy it [@kelemen2017more].

So far, it seems that work is considered to bring values,
but what if the opposite is true instead?

Some scholars argue that any work usually involves some negative effects to
them as well [@todd2017ever].
