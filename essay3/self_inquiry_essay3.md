Bahá'u'lláh promote for a future where human build a world-wide community and
act in the interest of the whole human race [@boyles1996meaning].
However, I note that, as of today,
the internet has probably spread more toxicity than peace:
"Twitter has been claimed to be where anyone would gain hatred,"
and "Redditers are usually commented as someone who prove 'we cannot have nice
things'" [@he2023annotations].
As a potential reason,
the internet has enabled information in general to spread quicker,
but negative information, by human nature,
spreads much faster than positive information.

Moralists argue that one should always prevent negative events if they could,
given that such prevention would not cause more negativity [@singer1972famine].
I observe that people judge whether something is negative based on their
perspectives,
and that their judgement of negativity level largely depends on how much they
can perceive about the event:
"[f]rom the perspective of someone in Bengal,
their fellow Bengali dying is surely among the worst;
from someone on the other side of the earth,
they cannot or can barely feel the negativity if they are not following the
issue very closely" [@he2023annotations].

Moralists also claim that, if most people do what they could do to help,
then the suffering would suffer less [@singer1972famine].
But, help can go into the wrong hands.
As I comment: "The donations to the Red Cross Society of China for the 2008
Wenchuan Earthquake, for one, infamously went to the embezzlers,
after which a prostitute was given all the blame and sent to jail"
[@he2023annotations].

Even back in the 90s, some have already worried
"that people will get so engulfed in a simulacrum virtual reality"
[@wellman1999net].
It seems true that a lot of people have indeed been captured by various
virtual worlds—we see them focus exclusively on their phones during the day.

We can also observe that people are more willing to help strangers online
verses in real life [@wellman1999net].
There may be multiple reasons for that.
The nature of virtual communication provides ease to retrieve from
conversations [@wellman1999net],
and the small amount of information it takes to help strangers online lowers
the risk that the stranger gathers information and takes advantage of the user
[@he2023annotations].
