The internet fundamentally changes communities.
It is so powerful in that it connects billions of people across the world
regardless of the physical distance between them.
As a technology so important,
does the internet do more good or bad to communities?
More importantly, why?

It is clear that the internet has a huge and controversial impact on
communities.
Even back in the 90s, some have already worried
"that people will get so engulfed in a simulacrum virtual reality"
[@wellman1999net].
Today, it seems clearly true that a lot of people have indeed been captured by
various virtual worlds—we can see people almost everywhere tirelessly chatting
over WeChat, Intagram, and other online platforms all day,
focusing exclusively on their phones, even when walking around.
The internet shifted a good portion of communities to virtuality.

As people get accustomed to connecting to their friends over a distance,
the internet seems to promote building global communities.
Bahá'u'lláh envisions a future where human build a world-wide community and
act in the interest of the whole human race [@boyles1996meaning].
As we can see at DKU, many people get to know and chat with friends from other
corners of the world over the internet.
As more people get to know people away from them,
they learn to understand and appreciate diversity,
so the world-wide community Bahá'u'lláh promotes is more likely to come true.

However, I note that, as of today,
the internet has probably spread more toxicity than peace.
"Twitter has been claimed to be where anyone would gain hatred,"
and "Redditers are usually commented as someone who prove 'we cannot have nice
things'" [@he2023annotations].
We hear criticisms about the internet spreading hate all the time,
but we seldom hear people praise the internet for spreading good information.

Why has the internet spread more negativity than good?
As a technology, the internet has enabled information in general to spread
quicker.
Negative information, however,
is discovered to spread much faster than positive information [@fox2018fake].
I have heard people comment that the number of "retweets" is a good indicator
of the number of dislikes a tweet has.
This is inline with our experience that people get excited to complain about
what they disagree but seldom talk about what they are satisfied with.
So, the difference in the speed the internet spreads negative information and
positive information is probably one of the reason why it spreads more bad than
good.

But, why do people tend to spread negativity online?
Are they not supposed to prevent these bad things?

The fact is that preventing bad is a hard request for most people because
of perspectives.
Even though
moralists argue that one should always prevent negative events if they could,
given that such prevention would not cause more negativity [@singer1972famine],
I observe that people judge whether something is negative based on their
perspectives,
and that their judgement of negativity level largely depends on how much they
can perceive about the event:
"[f]rom the perspective of someone in Bengal,
their fellow Bengali dying is surely among the worst;
from someone on the other side of the earth,
they cannot or can barely feel the negativity if they are not following the
issue very closely" [@he2023annotations].
The same can be applied to communication on the internet.
For most individual negative events on the internet,
people may not consider them to be "very bad,"
so they tend to let the negative information spread, or even help it spread.

Another reason why negativity is promoted is the financial benefits of online
platforms.
Having active users is the main key for online platforms such as Facebook to
earn revenue, and negative events tend to gain much more traction,
so most recommendation AI algorithms learned to promote negativity to maximize
the profit for the companies [@fridman2023max].
As I argue in class, the role online platforms play cannot be ignored,
the power of Facebook and recently TikToc is well known in that they capture
so much human attention [@pouille2023ethics].
So, it is very possible that online platforms, in their need to capitalize,
have sacrificed the interest of the human race and
greatly helped promote negativity online.

On the other hand, if we regulate the platforms,
we would be able to solve a large portion of the problem, right?

Unfortunately, even if some people help with the situation,
their contribution can easily be undermined by a few people with ill intention.
Although moralists claim that, if most people do what they could do to help,
then the suffering would suffer less [@singer1972famine],
the reality is that help can easily go into the wrong hands.
As I comment, "[t]he donations to the Red Cross Society of China for the 2008
Wenchuan Earthquake, for one, infamously went to the embezzlers,
after which a prostitute was given all the blame and sent to jail"
[@he2023annotations].
The same situation could as well happen to the investment in online platforms
regulation.
We have seen big corporations' ability to pretend to comply with policies or
even react positively to criticisms, in, for example,
Apple's hardly helpful independent repair program in response to the
right-to-repair movement [@rossmann2019apple].
So, great care and monitoring are necessary to ensure that help is delivered
in place.

So far, it seems daunting that the internet is probably doing more bad than
good to communities and it is tricky to even help.
However, when the motivate to cause harm is low,
the internet also promotes much good.

We can observe that people are more willing to help strangers online
verses in real life [@wellman1999net].
There may be multiple reasons for that.
The nature of virtual communication provides ease to retrieve from
conversations [@wellman1999net],
and the small amount of information it takes to help strangers online lowers
the risk that strangers gather information and take advantage of users
[@he2023annotations].
I see many examples where people help others online.
For example, the Elixir language Discord channel are full of helpful people
who voluntarily point out mistakes in newcomers' programs and share with them
valuable experiences and advice.
In these cases, the internet helps communities thrive
when the financial incentives are low and the communities are well-behaved.

All in all, it is hard to judge whether the internet does more good or bad to
communities.
On the one hand, the internet helps spread negative information on online
platforms due to social constructs and the financial incentives for the
platforms;
on the other hand, the internet connects individuals across long distances
such that they can help each other and shape communities that represent humanity
instead of regional groups.
What is more important, though, is that we understand the reasons and takeaways.
First, the internet has the capability to spread information regardless of
their nature, so it is up to us to take advantage and promote
positive information.
Second, financially motivated players have helped spread negative information,
and we have to regulate and closely monitor them to ensure a healthy internet.
Last but not least, in low-incentive environments,
the internet has promoted people to help other
human beings and act in the benefits of the human race.
So, the internet has all the potential to do good to communities,
and only with great awareness, care, and efforts,
can we leverage such potential to maximize the benefits,
and build up helpful global communities.
